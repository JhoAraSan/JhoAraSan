### 10. Use a Custom Theme
- Save your `.omp.json` file (e.g., `craver-style.omp.json`)

#### PowerShell:
```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\craver-style.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
```

#### WSL (bash):
```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/.poshthemes/craver-style.omp.json)"
```

#### CMD + Clink
- Place the command in Clink's startup file (e.g., `~/.clink_profile`)

## üîÅ Transient Prompt (Clean Previous Prompts)

Add to your `.omp.json`:
```json
"transient_prompt": {
  "enabled": true
}
```

This hides the previous prompt and keeps your terminal clean after each command.
